# AndroidNDIIOUE5
Android integration for NDI streaming, cloned from original windows plugin, with some android checks.
NDI SDK is currently multiplatform, so changes are in android checks in build and pointing apl to .so.
Tested only the Broadcast component for now, working well on Samsung S10 and Xiaomi Pogo pad.
